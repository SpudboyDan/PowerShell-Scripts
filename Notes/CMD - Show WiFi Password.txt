*** SHOW WIFI PASSWORD ***
Network Shell is a useful command for documenting a WiFi password, along with other network information.
Here's the syntax for showing a specific wireless network's information, alongside its password:

netsh wlan show profile 'SSID-Name-Goes-Here' key=clear

*** IMPORTANT!!! ***
The command 'wlan' is just one of many tools accessible via Network Shell, but it is one I have had the most use for as of late.
It's important to include the parameter 'key=clear' at the end of this one-liner for the password to actually display.

*** HELP! I CAN'T FIND WHAT NAME I NEED TO USE FOR THE SSID! ***
If you're unsure of the SSID, here's the syntax to simply show each wlan profile:

netsh wlan show profiles

*** MISC ***
If for some reason, you're on the network, and you are too lazy to open up the WiFi GUI to find the name that way, here's the syntax to show active interfaces:

netsh wlan show interfaces
