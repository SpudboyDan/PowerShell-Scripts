*** SHOW DRIVE LATENCY ***

Use these commands to measure drive latency if you suspect there are issues with a drive you're using.
If you see either value of "ReadLatencyMax" or "WriteLatencyMax" showing as greater than 1000 (this value is in milliseconds),
then there is likely an issue with the drive.

*** IMPORTANT ***
This example assumes that your C-Drive (OS) is registered as Device Number 0 by PowerShell.

Get-PhysicalDisk -DeviceNumber 0 | Get-StorageReliabilityCounter | Select-Object -Property ReadLatencyMax, WriteLatencyMax
