This is an example of how you can reinstall a default\Appx\oobe app when it has been removed completely, even from provisioning.
To download the source files, you must first use winget:

	1.) Open the Windows Store App (download and install it from Microsoft's website if you do not have it installed)
	and find the default app you're looking for. In this example, we were looking for the Phone Link app. Search for the app by name
	and then click on the "Share" arrow directly to the right of the big blue "Get/Open" button and hit "Copy Link".

	2.) Copy the URL to notepad and truncate the URL after '/detail/' and before '?' like so:
	"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NMPJ99VJBWV?hl=en-us&gl=US&ocid=pdpshare" -> 9NMPJ99VJBWV

	3.) This truncated value is your app's special Microsoft Store Id. Open up command prompt (non admin) and
	run the following commands:
		
		winget source update && winget download --id 9NMPJ99VJBWV --exact --source msstore --architecture x64

	4.) Next, move the entire folder from your downloads and copy it under a folder of the same name.
	i.e., create a folder named "Microsoft.YourPhone_1.25012.100.0_Desktop_X64" if the msix file is named "YourPhone.Package_1.25012.100.0_x64.msix".
	This can vary, so just pay attention to how the same folders are named on computers with clean installations.

	5.) Finally, run the following commands in PowerShell:
		$MsixPath = "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.YourPhone_1.25012.100.0_Desktop_X64\YourPhone.Package_1.25012.100.0_x64.msix";
		$License = "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.YourPhone_1.25012.100.0_Desktop_X64\9NMPJ99VJBWV_License.xml";
		Add-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online -PackagePath $MsixPath -LicensePath $License;
